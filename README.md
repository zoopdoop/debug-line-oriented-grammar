# Debug Line Oriented Lezer Grammar

This repo exists to debug how to match end of file in a Lezer line-oriented grammar.

To test:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

**UPDATE**: this issue has been debugged thanks to Marijn's quick response on the [Lezer Discuss](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/how-to-match-end-of-file-in-line-oriented-grammars/3186).  The fixed grammer is in `fixed-example.grammar`.
